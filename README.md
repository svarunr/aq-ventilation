# Air Quality based Ventilation
The air quality based ventilation system was a project that I had created for the Embedded Systems course at York University; the goal was to get an understanding of embedded system design, testing and validation.

The system was required to sense the concentration of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the air and turn on a ventilation fan when a certain threshold is reached. The system would also output the current VOC concentration in the air using the SSD1306 I2C display along with the current motor speed for quick reference.

I decided to jump right into the deep end with this project since I wanted to learn the ins and outs of embedded system design and the intricacies and nuances that go into establishing communication with other systems in a network.
